								<p>A major attraction of IITI is its distinguished faculty members and flexible academics. The faculty at IITI is one of the finest among the Indian vocational institutes. Most members of the faculty are achievers in their own right as well as excellent teachers and mentors. Says one student, “Most of our professors are research scholars themselves and are deeply involved in their own subjects of interest. It is this attitude of our professors that really makes them special, and engaging for our students. It becomes especially important to have professors who think in this way for our students to get their answers and take their involvement in their courses to the next level”(And this is the reason why IITI is known for its quality research with a great impact factor.)</p>
								<p>While the academic curriculum forms a large part of the experience at IITI, the institute also offers a number of extracurricular activities that IITI students are encouraged to participate in. This ensures that students get an all-round education and are not confined to academic achievements alone. “All work and no play typically dull the mind. We are proud to be part of an institute that promotes a strong curriculum with a keen interest in participation beyond books,” says one IITI student.</p>
								<p>IITI is a place that also subscribes to the entrepreneurship philosophy. In fact many of IIT’s students spend a fair amount of time on their own projects and eventually launch them into full-fledged companies as soon as they pass out of IITI.</p>
								<p>Through Industry-Academia collaborations and sponsored projects, the institute offers a conducive environment in which new ideas can be generated, researched, and nurtured before they become industry ready.</p>
								<p>IITI also takes pride in hosting the biggest Fest in Central India, Fluxus which is a technical and cultural extravaganza witnessing a footfall of over 15k students, from across the country.</p>
